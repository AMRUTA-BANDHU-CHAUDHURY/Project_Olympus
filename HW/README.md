Project Olympus Hardware Project

Initially only two mechanical assembly files are included.  These files are not yet up to date with the specifications since we are incorporating the latest changes into the specifications first and then making the changes in the mechanical design.  We expect to get the changes incorporated by end of November.  Most of the changes are minor and related to debug I/O connectors of the Motherboard.  Please refer to the specification for the most up to date information.  Once they’re in sync, will state here and change the README.

There is currently an issue with files being too big for github.  Only the first file here posted to github.  I'v posted all three files also to owncloud document repository.
